# Executive Summary

Great ideas and meaningful conversations--these are the main drivers for TED, short for Technology, Education, Design, a nonprofit that hosts impactful talks. TED has come a long way since it started hosting conferences in 1984. It was only in 2006 that the company uploaded their first talk on the online video sharing platform and social media giant YouTube. Since then the company has had dozens of their talks uploaded online. It also started riding the podcast wave just last June 2020 by transforming their videos into audio form and making them available on audio-streaming service Spotify.

In this project, our group analyzed different features from TED's YouTube and Spotify accounts. We compared those features and derived insights as to how TED applies their strategy in relation to content uploaded on YouTube and Spotify. The data was extracted through the use of Google/Youtube and Spotify API. Results show that TED uploads more content on Youtube than on Spotify. In the case of content that is uploaded to both platforms, TED prioritizes availability of the content on Spotify first before going on YouTube. Audiences are not particularly picky as to the duration of the content but there is a noticeable view count when a YouTube-only video is just around 2-6 minutes. The data shows that top words for TED content are climate, change, health, and life.On the other hands, top speakers include Bill Gates with focused topics such as COVID and health. We further found out that speakers who had a second talk or conference had higher online engagement; TED can take advantage of this and do a series of talks for past speakers that were well-received.

This paper features a dataset that is limited in nature. We recommend future researchers to expand the scope of features and compare to other company profiles that are similar to TED. Both YouTube and Spotify APIs cculd also be explored further since there are a lot more parameters that can be used. With this, better insight and recommendations can be derived for TED's usage and consumption.
